# Predicting Adult attachment for Young Adults in the US and China
Authors: Tong Shen and Shannon Weaver, at the University of Connecticut

### Repository Overview
This repository includes data preparation and analysis scripts, and conference presentation materials. The code was written in Python. I created this repository to provide clear, step-by-step explanations of the data analysis process, promoting open research and transparency in academic studies.

### Research Questions
Research Question 1: How accurately and effectively can a comprehensive set of predictors (demographic information, relationship specific predictors, and family of origin experiences) predict adult attachment security?

Research Question 2: What are the key predictors of adult attachment security?

Research Question 3: Would the performance of a key predictor model trained on the American sample differ when applied to the Chinese sample?
